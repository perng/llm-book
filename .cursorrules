# Latex Book Project Cursor Rules


# Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with underscores for filenames (e.g., introduction_chapter.tex).

# Python Code
- Use the pythoncode environment for code blocks. Put the code in a figure environment with the caption of the function name it implements.

# Diagrams
- Use the tikz package for diagrams if possible. 
- If matplotlib is better for the diagram, generate the code as comment, which will be used to generate the diagram in a Jupyter Notebook.



# LaTeX Style Guidelines
- Follow consistent LaTeX styling conventions including indentation and commenting.
- Use relevant LaTeX packages to enhance formatting and typesetting (e.g., geometry, hyperref).

# Compilation
- Ensure any LaTeX compilation tasks (e.g., pdflatex, bibtex) are managed through IDE integration or command line scripts.

# Citations and References
- Maintain a consistent citation style using BibTeX. Import relevant papers into a `references.bib` file.

# Commenting
- Include explanatory comments within .tex files for structure and clarity.
